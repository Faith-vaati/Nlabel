<!-- Remember that fonts with spaces in the name must be wrapped in quotes for CSS.

Borders can be used to group and prioritize content.

If you inspect your .label element with your browser's developer tools, you may notice that it's actually 288 pixels wide instead of 270. This is because, by default, the browser includes the border and padding when determining an element's size.

To solve this, reset the box model by creating a * selector and giving it a box-sizing property of border-box.
