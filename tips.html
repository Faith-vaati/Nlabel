<!-- Remember that fonts with spaces in the name must be wrapped in quotes for CSS.

Borders can be used to group and prioritize content.

If you inspect your .label element with your browser's developer tools, you may notice that it's actually 288 pixels wide instead of 270. This is because, by default, the browser includes the border and padding when determining an element's size.

To solve this, reset the box model by creating a * selector and giving it a box-sizing property of border-box.


Lines can help separate and group important content, especially when space is limited.

Create a div element below your h1 element, and give it a class attribute set to divider.




The letter-spacing property can be used to adjust the space between each character of text in an element.
